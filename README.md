# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub flow.
I am supposed to be writing a bit about myself. I am working on swirl in Rstudio right now. I am concurrently doing Coursera's Data Scientist's Toolbox in the hope that it will help me to better comprehend the commands that the swirl is isntructing me to use. Unfortunately, the lesson I am on in Coursera promtped me to complete a tutorial within Github, so I am not making progress on Swirl.
